# CITA - Continuous Integration Tool for APL

Currently this is used internally @ dyalog, but open for anyone to
pick up and use. Local testing (as opposed to "remote testing with Jenkins")
is currently beta-tested internally, the remote functionality is still under
discussion & development.

Most documentation is on the developers harddrive atm ;)  Please feel free to
ask for any details that are not obvious.

## Installation

Requires v18. If you want to use ]DTest or the ]GetTools4CITA User commands,
you need the CITA-Branch of [DBuildTest](https://github.com/Dyalog/DBuildTest).
